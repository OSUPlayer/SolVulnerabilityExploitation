In, our empirical study, we conduct comparison on the effectiveness among tools and evaluation on results by scanning the implementation of tools. The study was completed on a dataset with **76354** smart contracts. Also, we list several real code which are suspiciously vulnerable and exhibit exploitations on our pages.
